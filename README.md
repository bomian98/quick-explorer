This repo is forked from PJ Eby's [Quick Explorer plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/quick-explorer).

It has been set `autoPreview` to `false`, preventing the contents of the folder being obscured.

You can download `dist` folder, and move it into Obsidian Plugin folder(`'.obsidian/plugins'` by default), and then refresh plugin list in Obsidian or restart Obsidian.

After that, you can find `Quick Explorer No Preview` plugin in Obsidian plugin list.

If you want, you can also press `Tab` to preview content of the file.
